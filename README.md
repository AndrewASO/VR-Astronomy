# VR-Astronomy

* Should take in the measurements of the different stars from the csv and calculate their positions according to the location on Earth & the year displayed in a VR environment.
* Inputs should be location(lat/long) & time(year/month) with the stars being displayed of what should be seen according to those inputs.
* Will be focusing on constellation stars first to reduce calculation time, then working on adding other stars later on.
* Currently thinking of ways to process 120+ star locations concurrently without taking up too much processing power or to find a way to reduce calculation time / calculation needed.
* Possibly store all of the already calculated star charts within a db for easier access.
